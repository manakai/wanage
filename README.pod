  App.       Common     Generic       TCP/HTTP

  logic      operations interpret.    handling

They are I<not> Web application frameworks (WAFs).  They only provide
abstraction for interpretation of HTTP requests and construction of
HTTP response in the level enough to create Web applications easily by
just understanding how HTTP works.  They does not define how you
organize your Web application.  They can be used in conjection with a
random Perl WAF, as long as it does not prevent you from accessing raw
HTTP request and/or response, if desired.

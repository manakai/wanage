=head1 NAME

Wanage::Interface::CGI - Wanage interface module for CGI

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Wanage::Interface::CGI> module defines an adaptor to use CGI
interface within the Wanage abstraction.  It supports CGI in Unix
environments.

The CGI server must support CGI/1.1 for HTTP protocol in Unix systems.
It must also support the C<REQUEST_URI> meta-variable.  If the server
implements the C<https:> URL scheme, it must set the C<HTTPS>
meta-variable either C<ON>, C<on>, or C<1>.  (The last requirement is
a willful violation to RFC 3875 for compatibility with real-world CGI
server implementations.)

The module does not always assure the response generated by it
conforms to the CGI specification.  For example, although RFC 3875
requires document responses containing C<Content-Type:> CGI header
field, this module does not generate C<Content-Type:> header field
unless it is so specified by the application.  This is a willful
violation to the CGI specification to respect the intention of the Web
application author and due to the fact the requirement is not in fact
enforced by popular server implementations including Apache HTTP
server.

This module is not expected to be invoked directly from applications.
Applications should use L<Wanage::HTTP> API instead.

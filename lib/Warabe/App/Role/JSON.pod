=over 4

=item $data = $app->request_json

Decode JSON data in the request-body and return it.  If there is no
request-body, or if the request-body is not a JSON data, the C<undef>
value is returned.

This method does not check the value of the C<Content-Type:> header.
It should be done by the application if it is desired or forced to
check the value of the header by appropriate specifications.

=item $app->send_json ($data)

Send the given data, encoded in JSON format, as the response-body.
The data must be a value that can be encoded into JSON by L<JSON::XS>.

The C<Content-Type:> header is set to C<application/json>.
